# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 13

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We continue our three-week investigations of **graphs**. After having looked primarily at terminology, definitions, _un-directed_ and _directed_ graphs, we now turn to: 

- Minimum Spanning Trees; **Prim's Algorithm**
- Shortest Paths' Problem; **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- If time permits: brief repeat of topological sorting on digraphs (the Kosaraju-Sharir Algorithm)

The first two items are needed as part of Assignment #4, Airline Networks.

NB: we did not have sufficient attendance during lecture hours this week, we will have two student groups as anchor teams in a discussion of solutions to Assignment #3 (Airport Queueing) instead this week. And, please, make an effort to arrive on time. 

-----------------
### Classroom Activities 

- The teams **_'NSquared'_** and **_'NoGroup'_** have volunteered to briefly present their work on hand-in assignment #3 ('Airport Queueing'), and facilitate feedback and discussion. Active participation by all of us should be self-evident.
- Some exercise on BigO analysis: derivation of series summation, fx.
- Review of exercises from last week, by peer presentations and discussion (if needed).
- Pop-up quizzes.
- Walk-through of excerpt material from Chapters 4.3 and 4.4 of the textbook.

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** 8-10 hrs (incl. for project).

-----------------
### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, read chapter 4.3 and 4.4 of 'Algorithms 4th Edition' (see also ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)). You should focus on: 

- Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms (in Ch 4.3)
- Dijkstra's (greedy) Algorithm (in Ch 4.4)
- Space/time complexity charts (you know E+V or E+VlogE etc.) for both MSTs and Shortest Paths.

**Lecture Slides:** will be available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_11/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf) after classroom session.

**Code:** you should go through the exercises, given in class, _**with your group**_ from scratch. Some assistance, however, is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), and other locally facilitated resources found on GitHub. 

Please make sure to have a working environment with the code base for 'Algorithms, 4th Edition' (you know, alg4.jar). This was one of the first things we were doing in week 1, and you should have been ok with that by now.

**Classroom exercises:** Will be in the context of Chapters 4.3 and 4.4 of the reading material. Namely on MSTs -- Prim's Algorithm, and Shortest Paths -- Dijkstra's Algorithm. And a bit of repeat on BigO analyses.
