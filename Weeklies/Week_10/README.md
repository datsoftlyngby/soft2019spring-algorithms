# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 10

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We will continue Priority queues, in particular around heaps and heap sorting this week. Since we had some confusion last week about heaps, we will review that in a bit of detail, and round off with the heap sort algorithm illustrated. This week will be recapturing, and not so intense about theory. There will be some time left over to work on the Assignment 3, as I understand the intensity is up on the other courses.

**Lecture Slides:** are available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_06/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf), on an incremental basis.

**Code:** you should go through exercises _**with your group**_, from scratch, although some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
