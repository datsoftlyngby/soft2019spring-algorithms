# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 15

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
This week, we will have all groups presenting their work and results on the Assignment #4. Since you have had an extension and we have been rather thorough in going through the graphs' material, it should make for a great discussion and possibly plenty of points/differences.This week, we will have all groups presenting their work and results on the Assignment #4. We decided to extend the deadline by a week. We have been rather thorough in going through the graphs' material, and it should make for a great discussion and possibly plenty of points/differences.

We will look a bit more on graphs, but we are through the essentials.

We have the results from the Mentimeter Poll on your self-evaluation with respect to the curriculum and course contents. This is really an important exercise; 10 out of 13 have answered the poll so far. NB: For those that have not yet submitted your input - you can still make it before tomorrow's classroom.

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- Mentimeter: review of curriculum self-evalution results
- Presentation from all groups of Assignment #4, Airline Network
