# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 19

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We are nearing the end of the course, and we are through the first run on theory. 

The coming two weeks are devoted to working on the final Hand-in assignment, #5. Classroom time will be run as open workshop, and you are encouraged to help eachother, also across groups -- you have different knowledge and competencies. :-)

NB: Anders Kalhauge will joining us for the final few weeks, and will help out in the projects for our final Hand-in (number 5). He will also help us in reviewing the theory from the first 15 weeks of the semester.

- Work in groups on Project 5; your groups' topics have been chosen between four topics, which we presented during week 18.

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** 5-6 hours - for choosing and defining project. Together with your group, write a half-page abstract on the topic you have chosen.

### Resources

**Reading:** 

- Read in the _'Algorithms, 4th Edition'_, generally to pick up on stuff you're not comfortable with -- before the exam!
- Reading is recommended to get a grip on your topic for Project 5.

**Code:** possibly some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). But it depends on which topic you have chosen for your Project 5.
