## Algorithms & Data Strutures - Spring 2019

----------------
### Week 05
* Course information and material is availble though the course's [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150).
* Announcements -- fx about weeklies like this one you're reading -- are given through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

**Main Subject:** Introduction to the course, expectations, infrastructure, the overall plan for the semester. Simple algorithms, analysis, exercises.

**Subject & Goal:** Insertion sort, selection sort. Scaling of algorithms, big O notation.

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** You should probably spend some 4-5 hours outside class this time only. The concepts of analysis of algorithms is extremely central in this course, so be careful to read (and read again) Chapters 1.4 and 2.1 .

-----------------
### Resources
**Reading:** Chapter 1.4, 2.1 of 'Algorithms 4th edition', see ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) for abbreviated online version of the reading material. It is highly recommended that you read through the material, and familiarize yourselves with the basic concepts plots, tables etc.

**Lecture Slides:** are available from [this current repository]().

**Code:** you should do this yourselves, but some assistance is avaible through the booksite. It often is a good idea to team up outside class too. You can get much further, faster, if you're helping eahcother to ideas.

**Classroom exercises:** TBD (to-be-determined) -- but will be taken in context of the chapters 1.4 and 2.1 of reading material.

### NB: Hand-in group project number 1
**Assignment 01 - Sorting Shakespeare's Collected Works:** is made available from first day of this week. It has a deadline of 15/2, 08:30. You can find it in [this weekly's assignment folder](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/tree/master/Weeklies/Week_05/Assignment_01).
