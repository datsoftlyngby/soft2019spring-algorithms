### Algorithms & Data Strutures - Spring 2019

#### Week 05
* Course information and material is availble though the Moodle flow.
* Announcements -- fx about weeklies like this one you're reading -- are made through the Moodle flow. 

##### Main Subject

1. Introduction to the course, expectations, infrastructure and the overall plan (My makeshift Excel Sheet :-) ).
2. Simple algorithms, analysis.

##### Subject & Goal
 * Insertion sort, selection sort.
 * scaling of algorithms, big O notation.

#### Resources
**Reading:** Chapter 1.4, 2.1 of 'Algorithms 4th edition', see ["Booksite"]() for abbreviated online version of the reading material.

It is highly recommended that you read through the material, and familiarize yourselves with the basic concepts plots, tables etc.

**Code:** you should do this yourselves, but some assistance is avaible through the booksite.

#### Classroom exercises
TBD.

#### Hand-in group projects
Assignment 01 - Sorting Shakespeare's Collected Works, is made available from first day of this week. It has a deadline of 15/2, 08:30. You can find it in [this week's weekly folder](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/tree/master/Weeklies/Week_05/Assignment_01).

#### Estimated need for activity out side classroom
You should probably spend some 4-5 hours outside class this time only. The concepts of analysis of algorithms is extremely central in this course, so be careful to read (and read again) Chapters 1.4 and 2.1 .
