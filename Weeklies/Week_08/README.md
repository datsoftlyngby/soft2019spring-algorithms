# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 08

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We continue the topic of symbol tables (STs) and abstract data structures (ADS), starting out with Anders Kalhauge guest starring with talks about hashing tables (and hashing of STs). 

From last week we learned that various data structures, such as unordered list STs and ordered array STs significantly different perormance during search, insertion, deletion ($N$ vs. $N lg N$, or even $lg N$).

This week we look at tree ADSs; binary trees, 2-3 / red-black trees, and touch lightly upon balanced search trees which generalize concepts tree-searchable symbol tables.

### Classroom Activities 

- Mentimeter [www.menti.com](https://www.menti.com), weekly check-up.
- Infrastructure check. Are we well within our learning platform?
- If needed: review of exercises from last week, by peer presentation and discussion.
- Lectures & Exercises.

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** A good 6-7 hours this week. Mostly due to reading and a few central exercises, but also since you will now have full the foundation to complete your hand-in #2, on searching Sharespeare by various means.

### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, read chapter 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 of 'Algorithms 4th Edition' (see ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) for abbreviated online version). **Reading Guide:** Focus on chapter 3.2 (40%), dealing with binary trees. Then browse chapter 3.3 (20%) and give ch.3.4 a goos glance (40%). Keep your focus on how the different structural approaches improves complexity in the construction, and searchability of symbol tables.

**Lecture Slides:** are available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_06/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf), on an incremental basis.

**Code:** you should go through the exercises _**with your group**_, from scratch, although some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

**Classroom exercises:** TBD (to-be-determined) -- but will be taken in context of the chapters 3.2-3.4 of reading material.
