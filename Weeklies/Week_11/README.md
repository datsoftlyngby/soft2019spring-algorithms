# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 11

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We are now leaving queues, heaps and finally sorting behind (we included heap sort last week). 

For the coming three weeks, we shall delve into **graphs**. Undirected graphs, directed graphs, cyclic graphs, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), depth-first-search (DFS), breadth-first-search (BFS).

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- Mentimeter: **NO** mentimeter this time. :-) 
- Review of exercises from last week, by peer presentations and discussion (if needed).
- Group presentation of Hand-in assignment #2.
  - The teams **_'Konstanten N'_** and **_'Big O'_** have volunteered to present their work on hand-in assignment #2 ('Searching Shakespeare'), and facilitate feedback, generally.
- A few exercises, which will ask for your creativity.
- A few pop-up quizzes.


**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** 4-6 hrs.

-----------------
### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, read chapters 4.1 and 4.2 of 'Algorithms 4th Edition' (see ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) for abbreviated online version). 

**Lecture Slides:** will be available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_11/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf) after classroom session.

**Code:** you should go through the exercises, given in class, _**with your group**_ from scratch. Although some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), and other local resources.

**Classroom exercises:** TBD (to-be-determined). Will be given in context of the chapters 4.1 and 4.2 of the reading material.
