# Algorithms & Data Strutures - Spring 2019

## Week 07

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
Abstract data structures (ADSs), and searching ADSs. 

We left algorithmic analysis and sorting, only to find that also the data structures, which we employ, could hold serious impact on code comprehension, complexity and performance. We shall begin to look into structure as well, starting this week with basics and then -- more importantly -- examples.

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- Check: did we all hand in assignment #1, properly submitted to peergrade?
- Review of exercises from last week, by peer presentations and discussion. Team _'NSquared'_ is anchor on (but accountable for) the review.
- Student Q & A session

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** This week has some serious coding ahead. Sp you may find that 6 hours may suffice, but think '8' instead. I will relieve some of that to be started off during classroom time, since the lectures will be a bit more sparse this week.

-----------------
### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, read chapters 1.3, 3.1 and 3.2 of 'Algorithms 4th Edition' (see ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) for abbreviated online version). 

**Lecture Slides:** available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_07/Slides/03%20Searching%20Lists.pdf), soon.

**Code:** you should go through the classroom exercises _**with your group**_, from scratch, although some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

**Classroom exercises:** TBD, but will be taken in context of the chapters 1.3, 3.1 and 3.2 of reading material.

**Workshop Hours:** p.t. most probably Tuesdays 12:30-14:00 in the cubicles in the corridor.
