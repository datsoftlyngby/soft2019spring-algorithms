# Algorithms & Data Strutures - Spring 2019

## Week 06

(Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150)) 

-----------------

### Focus this week
Simple algorithms, analysis, exercises; continued. We will take a look at a more efficient sorting algorithm, and start to appreciate that even the structure/sorting of data matters when choosing/coding your software. Remember your big O analysis and Tree-sort from Week 05.

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- [Infrastructure](www.menti.com), is everyone set? :

  * **Java**-devel Check
  * **Moodle**-access Check
  * **Github**-clone Check
  * **Peergrade**-access Check.

- Mentimeter [www.menti.com](https://www.menti.com): are we close to (but not in!) our comfort zone? Instructions on how to join the poll will be given in class.

- [Workshop Hours](www.menti.com), TBD -- when are the optimal hours here?

- Student Q & A session on the 1st Hand-in Assignment ('Sorting Shakespeare'), to make sure we're all clear on how to progress.
- We will review the exercises from last week, by peer presentations and discussion, to see how far we could get during introductory week. :-)
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and exercises to follow.


**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** Some 6 hours outside class, including reading. The concepts of analysis of algorithms should be fairly well established by end of Week 5. If not, be careful to review Chapters 1.4 and 2.1 of the book 'Algorithms 4th Edition' or browse through -- and understand -- the nitty-gritty details of the excerpts at ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

-----------------
### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, read Chapters 2.2 and 2.3 of 'Algorithms 4th Edition' (see ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) for abbreviated online version). 

**Lecture Slides:** are available from [the present repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_06/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf).

**Code:** you should go through the exercises **with your group**, from scratch, although some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

**Classroom exercises:** TBD (to-be-determined) -- but will be taken in context of the chapter 2.2 of reading material.

**Workshop Hours:** I will be settling on a module during the week, where I will be stationed in a room/office space on the CPHBUS campus, so that we might get a chance to look over the things that you (or I) are wondering about. It will be announced on the Moodle Flow ASAP.
