# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 14
**NB: change of venue: we shall be in Room CL-305, this week.**

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We continue a bit with graphs. Benjamin has volunteeringly offered to give a review of the **_A<b>*</b> Shortest Path Algorithm_**, which is parametrized based on heuristics. Thank you Benjamin! Student involvement at this level is certainly most welcomed and encouraged.

Also, this week I have planned a regression through the past weeks of the course. We will slowly flip some slides, asking ourselves if we're grasping some of the fundamental ideas. Also; we shall do some exercises on the **_Dijkstra's_** and **_A* Algorithms_**.

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- Shortest Paths Tree; Dijkstra’s Algorithm, recap by exploration.
- Shortest Path: the **_A* Algorithm_**, student presentation. Benjamin has volunteered to present the A* Algorithm. Active student participation is encouraged. Thank you Benjamin!
- Some Exercises 
- Regression session – where do we stand? [a self-service check] We’re at a divide: should we fastforward, or fastreverse a bit from here?

**Estimated need for activity outside classroom:** 7-9 hours (in reviewing past material).

-----------------
### Resources

**Reading:** No textbook reading for this week. _However_: a serious checkup on the **_A* Algorithm_**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm -- and the meaning of **free parameters**, relaxation of optimality constraints, and planarity of graphs. 

**Lecture Slides:** are available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_14/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf), on an incremental basis.

**Code:** you should go through the exercises _**with your group**_, from scratch, although some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

**Classroom exercises:** TBD (to-be-determined) -- but will be taken in context of the lecturing and reading material.
