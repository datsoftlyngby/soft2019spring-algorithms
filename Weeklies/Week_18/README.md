# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 18

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We are nearing the end of the course, and the theoretical part of the curriculum. 

The last two topics we cover will also form part of the basis for two out of the three _elective topics_ for the final Hand-in assignment #5. Yes, you get to choose! :-)

We will cover 'Tries' which is a powerful concept data structures and algorithms for text mining. We will also talk about KD-Trees, which extends our talk on binary trees and balanced trees earlier in the semester.

NB: Anders Kalhauge will join us for the final few weeks, and will be covering 'Tries' in text mining, as well as help out in the projects for our final Hand-in (number 5). He will also help out when we begin reviewing topics from the first 15 weeks of the semester.

### Classroom Activities 

- The plan ahead
- Test Exam hand-back
- 'Tries' and text mining
- KD-Trees
- Final Mandatory Project 5 assignment handed-out. Topic can be chosen between three, which we will defined in Class.

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** 6-7 hours incl. reading.

### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, just browse through Chapter 5.1, but read carefully Chapter 5.2, in 'Algorithms 4th Edition' (see ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) for abbreviated online version). Also check out this quite amusing video on [KD-Trees](https://youtu.be/Z4dNLvno-EY), and find some good reference to brush up KD-Trees, fx Wikipedia.

**Lecture Slides:** are available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_06/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf), on an incremental basis.

**Code:** you should go through the exercises _**with your group**_, from scratch, although some assistance is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

**Classroom exercises:** TBD -- will be taken in context of the chapter ... of reading material.
