# Algorithms & Data Structures - Spring 2019

## Week 12

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3150). 

-----------------

### Focus this week
We continue our three-week investigations of **graphs**. After having looked primarily at terminology, definitions and __un-directed__ graphs, we now turn our attentions to __directed__ graphs, aka **digraphs**. Topics we shall cover are; cyclic graphs, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). And a few algorithms, among which can be found the Dijkstra Algorithm.

Since we did not have time during week 11 to finish our exercises, in particular the graph synthesis, we will see if we can find a bit of time to get some of it done this week instead.

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- Date for both the course evaluation, and the mid-term exam, has been agreed for the 23/4.
- Review of exercises from last week, by peer presentations and discussion (if needed).
- Group presentation of Hand-in assignment #3.
  - The teams **_'NSquared'_** and **_'NoGroup'_** have volunteered to present their work on hand-in assignment #3 ('Airport Queueing'), and facilitate feedback, generally.
- A few exercises, which will ask for your creativity.
- Pop-up quizzes.

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** 3-5 hrs.

### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, read chapter 4.2 of 'Algorithms 4th Edition', thoroughly (see also ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)). 

**Lecture Slides:** will be available through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/blob/master/Weeklies/Week_11/Slides/02%20Introduction.pdf) after classroom session.

**Code:** you should go through the exercises, given in class, _**with your group**_ from scratch. Some assistance, howeverm, is available through the ["Booksite"](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), and other locally fcilitated resources found on GitHub.

**Classroom exercises:** Will be given in context of the chapters 4.1 and 4.2 of the reading material.
